# Architecture Overview

## Project Structure
The EFFECTSFXX project is organized into several key directories and files, each serving a specific purpose:

- **README.md**: Provides an overview of the project and instructions for setup and usage.
- **LICENSE**: Contains the project's license information.
- **.gitignore**: Specifies files and directories to be ignored by Git, such as `node_modules`, `.env`, and OS-specific files.
- **docs/**: Contains documentation files, including architecture notes.
- **public/**: Holds the main HTML file (`index.html`) that serves as the entry point for the application.
- **src/**: Contains the source code, including assets (styles and images) and scripts.
- **scripts/**: Includes scripts for building and running the application.
- **config/**: Contains configuration files, including a sample environment variable file.
- **.env**: Used for local environment variables, ignored by Git.
- **backups/**: Placeholder for backup files.
- **scratch/**: Placeholder for temporary files or experiments.
- **data/**: Contains directories for raw and processed data files.

## Architecture Notes
The project follows a standard structure for web applications, separating concerns into distinct directories. This modular approach enhances maintainability and scalability.

- **Frontend**: The frontend consists of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files located in the `public` and `src` directories. The `public/index.html` file links to the main CSS and JS files, ensuring a clean separation of content and presentation.
  
- **Assets**: All styles are located in `src/assets/styles/main.css`, while images are stored in `src/assets/images/`. This organization allows for easy management of visual assets.

- **Scripts**: The main JavaScript functionality is encapsulated in `src/scripts/main.js`, which currently outputs "Hello World" to the console. This file can be expanded as the project grows.

- **Build and Run**: The `scripts/build_and_run.sh` file provides instructions for building and running the application, streamlining the development process.

- **Configuration**: Environment variables are managed through the `config/sample.env` file, with a `.env` file for local development settings.

This architecture is designed to facilitate collaboration and ease of development, making it suitable for both small and large-scale projects.
